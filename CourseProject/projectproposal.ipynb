    "### Summary of Statistical Tests Discussed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression for Ordinal Categorical Data**\n",
    "   - We discussed using logistic regression to predict probabilities for outcomes in ordinal categorical data. This method allowed us to model the likelihood of different outcomes based on an independent variable, particularly useful for understanding relationships in ordinal datasets.\n",
    "   - We covered topics such as train-test splits, outcome probabilities without splitting, and interpreting predicted probabilities. Sample outputs were provided to illustrate how results would look.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chi-Squared Test of Independence**\n",
    "   - The Chi-Squared Test of Independence was considered to assess associations between categorical variables. This non-parametric test evaluates whether there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables.\n",
    "   - We also discussed calculating degrees of freedom for Chi-Squared tests and interpreting p-values to determine whether associations were statistically significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fisher’s Exact Test for 2x2 Tables**\n",
    "   - We examined Fisher’s Exact Test as an alternative to the Chi-Squared Test for small sample sizes or cases with low expected frequencies in contingency tables. Fisher’s Exact Test is especially useful for 2x2 tables, where it provides an exact p-value rather than an approximation.\n",
    "   - We reviewed how Fisher’s Exact Test calculates exact probabilities using factorials and the odds ratio as a measure of association. We clarified that the test is limited to binary categories and is more accurate than the Chi-Squared Test for small or uneven datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Odds Ratios and Interpretation**\n",
    "   - For cases where Fisher’s Exact Test was applied, we reviewed the concept of the odds ratio to measure the strength and direction of associations between two binary variables. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicated a positive association, while less than 1 indicated a negative association.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **General Considerations for Statistical Tests**\n",
    "   - Throughout the discussions, we emphasized when each test was appropriate based on the nature of the data (e.g., ordinal vs. binary categories) and sample size constraints. We also discussed the interpretation of p-values across all tests to determine statistical significance and guide conclusions.\n",
